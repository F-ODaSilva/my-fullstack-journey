## Exercices

### Task 1

Create a .js file called controlStructures.js. You don't have to create an
HTML page for this task. You can write all your output to the console.

* Declare three variables called **"num1"**, **"num2"**, and **"num3"**. Assign each variable a number value.
* Now write a conditional statement that compares **"num1"** and **"num2"** and
displays the larger value.
* Write a conditional statement that determines whether "num1" is odd or
even and displays the result. (Tip: remember the modulus operator %)
* Next, write a JavaScript conditional statement to sort the three numbers
from largest to smallest.
* Write a JavaScript for loop that will display the numbers 0 - 20.
* Now write a JavaScript while loop that will display the numbers 0 - 20.
* Next, create a for loop that will display all even numbers between 1 and 20.
* Create a for loop that will produce the following output:

```bash
*
**
***
****
*****
```

Use nested loops (i.e. a loop within a loop).

* Write a for loop to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD - also called
the Highest Common factor (HCF)) of two positive integers of your choice.
