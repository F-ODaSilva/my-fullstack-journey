1. You use a for loop hen you know the ammount of times a loop will be runnig depending on the expression inside the loop. It keeps the counter, the condition, and the increment all in one line.
2. You use a while loop when you don't know how many repetitions are needed. It runs as long as a specific condition is true.Reading a file until you reach the end, or waiting for a user to click a specific button.
3. Use it when the code must run at least once, regardless of whether the condition is true or false at the start.It executes the code first, then checks the condition to see if it should repeat.
4. An infinite loop happens when the exit condition is never met.
