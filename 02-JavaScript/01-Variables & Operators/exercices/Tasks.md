## Exercices

### Task 1

* Create a JavaScript file called myVariables.js.
* Create a variable called “language” and assign it the value “JavaScript”. Then
create a variable called “score” and assign it the value “10”. Write both
variables to the console.
* Create two variables called “length” and “width”. Assign each variable a
value. Use the variables to calculate the area of a rectangle with the length
and width specified (remember area = length x width). Write the following
to the console: “The area of the rectangle is …” where … is the area you
calculated.
* Create two variables called “num1” and “num2.” Assign each variable a value.
Calculate and display what the remainder is if num1 is divided by num2.
* OPTIONAL: Using the variables you created in the previous step, output the
results of the division in the following format: “num1 / num2 = x remainder
y.” (Research Math.trunc to get this to work.)

### Task 2

* Create a .js file called dataTypes.js.
* Define variables of the following data types, assigning them appropriate
values of your choice:
    1. Integer
    2. String
    3. Array
    4. Object
* Once you’ve created the variables, display them to the console.
* Use the ‘typeof’ function to check each variable.
* Create an array with numbers and strings. Comment what type you expect
this to be.
* Use the ‘typeof’ function on this array.
* Create a null variable and an undefined variable (you’ll need to do some
research to do this).
* Use Beautify to improve the readability of your code
