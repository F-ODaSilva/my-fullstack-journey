# Full-Stack Journey 🚀

This repository documents my structured learning journey in modern web development and full-stack engineering.

It is a **rebuild of my learning path and projects based on my course curriculum**, created after I lost my previous files and work. Instead of simply recreating what was lost, I chose to rebuild everything in a more organized, documented, and intentional way.

It serves as a personal knowledge base, a progress tracker, and a public portfolio of concepts, experiments, and projects as I grow from fundamentals to production-grade systems.

The goal is not only to learn tools and frameworks, but to understand how web applications are designed, built, tested, deployed, secured, and maintained in real-world environments.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Rebuild my lost learning materials and projects in a structured way.
- Build a strong foundation in web development and software engineering.
- Practice concepts through examples, exercises, and projects.
- Document learning in a clear, structured, and reproducible way.
- Create a long-term reference and portfolio.
- Develop the mindset and skills of a professional full-stack engineer.

## 🧭 How This Repository Is Organized

The repository is organized as a progressive learning path, from fundamentals to advanced topics.

Each section represents a phase of learning, and each phase is divided into modules and chapters.

Each chapter typically contains:

- `notes.md` — theoretical explanations and personal annotations  
- `examples/` — small, focused code examples  
- `exercises/` — practice problems and implementations  
- `projects/` — larger, integrated applications
